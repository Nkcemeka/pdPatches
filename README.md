# Pure Data Patches
So, a few years ago, I happened to stumble on Pure Data and really enjoyed it. As time went, I got distracted with the struggles of life and didn't return to it. Now, I am back. As a refresher, I am going through Miller Puckette's book on Pd, and I will be recreating some of his patches and also modifying them. I will also be creating unique stuff as well. Ta daaaa!

## Notes
- This project will contain VERY BASIC patches and build up in complexity
- This repo might contain recreated patches of Miller Puckette with tweaks
- Some of the patches here might be different and entirely unique (my mind is bubbling with ideas)
- If you find something here that interests you, feel free to give me a heads up
